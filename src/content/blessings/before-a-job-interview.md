*For the parking lot, the lobby, the waiting room. Wherever you land before you begin.*

## The Drop-In

Find a moment alone — even a bathroom stall works.

**Plant your feet.** Feel the ground. You are here, in a body, taking up space you are allowed to take up.

**Three breaths:**

1. **Inhale** — draw up from the earth. You have done hard things before.
2. **Exhale** — release the need to be perfect. They called *you*.
3. **Inhale** — fill your chest with your own presence.
4. **Exhale** — let your shoulders drop. You are not auditioning for your worth.

## The Words

Say silently, or whisper if you can:

> *I am not here to beg.*
> *I am here to explore a mutual fit.*
> *I bring real things to real problems.*
> *The right door opens. The wrong door saves me time.*

## The Anchor

Touch your thumb to your index finger — a small, invisible gesture.

This is your anchor. During the interview, if you feel yourself shrinking, touch it again. It returns you to this moment: grounded, worthy, clear.

## After

Win or lose, you walked in whole. That doesn't change based on their decision.

Shake it off. Get something to eat. You did the thing.
