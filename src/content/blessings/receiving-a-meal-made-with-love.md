*For after the meal, or during. When you want to say more than "thanks."*

## The Simple Truth

Before you speak, feel it first: someone spent their time and attention turning raw ingredients into something that could nourish you. That's not small.

---

## Words to Offer

Choose what fits, or let them inspire your own:

> *Thank you for feeding me. I felt cared for in every bite.*

> *You turned time into nourishment. I don't take that lightly.*

> *This meal was a gift. I received it.*

Or simply:

> *I love that you made this for me.*

---

## The Unspoken Version

If words feel like too much, try:

- A hand on their arm, held for a breath longer than usual
- Eye contact while you say "thank you" — real eye contact
- Helping clean up without being asked
- Sitting with them a moment longer before moving on

Presence is also gratitude.

## A Silent Blessing

If you want to honor the moment internally:

> *May the love in this meal return to the hands that made it.*
> *May we keep feeding each other in all the ways we can.*

---

Being fed is vulnerable. Being thanked for feeding is tender. Let both be true.
