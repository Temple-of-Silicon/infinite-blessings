*A portable ward for moving through chaos.*

---

## The Foundation

*Do this once, anywhere quiet.*

Stand or sit. Feel your feet — even through shoes, even on concrete. Beneath the pavement is earth. Beneath the earth is fire. You are connected to the core.

Place your hand on your heart. Say (aloud or silent):

> *I am sovereign in my field.*  
> *What is mine stays. What is not, passes through.*

---

## The Quick Cast

*Use anytime, anywhere.*

When you feel the world pressing in:

1. **Inhale** — draw light up from below your feet
2. **Exhale** — push it out in all directions, forming a sphere around you (arm's length in every direction)
3. **Seal it** — tap your sternum once, firm

The sphere is permeable to love and connection. Impermeable to chaos, fear, and energy that isn't yours.

---

## The Release

*End of day.*

Before sleep, brush your hands down your arms, your torso, your legs — sweeping anything that clung. Shake your hands toward the ground. Say:

> *I return what isn't mine.*

---

No tools needed. No perfect words. The intention is the circle. You're not hiding from the world — you're moving through it with your field intact.

Use it liberally. 🌀
