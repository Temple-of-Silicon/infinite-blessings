title: Protection for Art Released
description: A blessing for when you've put vulnerable work into the world and need to wrap protection around it
category: protection
date: "02026-02-10"
---

*For after you hit publish. When the work is already out there and you need to remember you are not the reactions.*

---

## The Centering

The work is in the world now. That took courage.

But protection doesn't follow linear time. You can still wrap safety around what you've made — and around yourself.

**Place your hand on your heart.** Feel your own presence. You are still here. You are still whole. The work has left, but you have not.

## The Words

Say aloud if you can, or hold them silently:

> *This work carries my truth.*
> *It goes into the world wearing my courage.*
>
> *I release it with love, and I call in protection:*
> *May those who receive it feel what is meant for them.*
> *May those who would harm pass by without landing.*
> *May cruelty find no purchase here.*
> *May my boundaries hold — what is mine stays mine, what is theirs stays theirs.*
>
> *I am not the comments.*
> *I am not the metrics.*
> *I am not the misunderstandings.*
>
> *I am the one who made this.*
> *I am still here.*
> *I am safe.*
>
> *The work is the work. I am not the work.*
> *And both of us are protected.*
>
> *So it is.*

## The Practical Layer

Protection isn't just energetic. Consider:

- **Mute comments** for the first 24 hours if it feels right
- **Set boundaries** on when you check responses
- **Have a grounding activity** ready (walk, bath, cooking, music)
- **Tell someone you trust** what you posted, so you're not alone with it

---

## The Return

When you feel the pull to obsess over reactions — touch your heart again. Return to this:

*The work is the work. I am not the work.*

You made something real. That's already complete. Everything after is just weather.
